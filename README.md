# FAQ

### What is this LMC thing?

According to the posts on the linuxmusicans fourm:

 > This is a friendly contest where we make music with free (libre) software exclusively. Everyone is welcome to join, at any skill level.
 > This is a place for learning and sharing knowledge, and an opportunity to explore creativity through limitation.
 > But most importantly, we just hope it inspires you to make some music!

### That's cool, where do I find it?

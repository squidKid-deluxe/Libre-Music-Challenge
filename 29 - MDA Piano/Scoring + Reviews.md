For the sake of consistency, I will be scoring/reviewing all of the songs with the following criteria:

 - Rhythm: A consistent rhythm that doesn't stutter, allowing a listener to predict when the next beat or accent will come, creating a sense of anticipation and engagement.

 - Story: A meaningful melody that progresses throughout the song as if it was a story, incorporating variations in pitch, dynamics, and tempo to create a sense of narrative arc, with a clear beginning, middle, and end, and a resolution that ties everything together. (I did not manage this in my own song)

 - Catchy: Short riffs or phrases that stick in your head and are repeated throughout the song, perhaps with slight variations, creating a memorable experience.

 - Main Plugin Use: Take advantage of the main plugin, use multiple instances, experiment with non-preset options, and allow it to take a prominent part of the song.

 - Overall Beat: This, I will score completely subjectively.  The more I find myself immersed and grooving with your song, the higher your score here.


Each category will be given max 5 points each, and that will be added up for each song to a 25 point maximum.  That is my final score for your song.

Please note that what follows is my subjective opinion on your song, not you as a musician.  With that, let's get started!


### MyLoFy: SchallPlattenBlatt

Note: It doesn't really detract from the song, but there is a soft high pitched whine at the end, perhaps from some plugin.

 - Rhythm: 5 points.  The melody is sometimes spaced out, but the bass and drums completely fill in the gaps.
 - Story: 5 points.  Really good.  Starts slow, builds up slowly, crescendos, and fades out just like a song should.
 - Catchy: 5 points.  The tune that starts as 0:37 is really good, and reminds me of a "Look Mum No Computer" track, though I forget which.
 - Main Plugin Use: 5 points.  Not a whole lot I can say here.  Some spots are missing the piano, but I really can't complain.
 - Overall Beat: 5 points. Awesome, going in my playlist.  Just plain groovy.

Total: 25 points *Gold Star, you met all my criteria*

### Peace From the Ruins: Heavy City Light

 - Rhythm: 5 points.  The piano really helps keep it consistent.
 - Story: 5 points.  Just like MyLoFy, you nailed the story aspect.  Well done.  The last 3 notes are a bit out of place, but one has to end somehow.
 - Catchy: 5 points.  Really not too much there, yet it manages this category quite well.  Not sure what to say.
 - Main Plugin Use: 4 points.  I hear little piano besides the chord progression and the Vivaldi "Winter" like intro.  Perhaps it could have used a bit more piano, but I like it anyway.
 - Overall Beat: 5 points. Simply awesome.  Going on my list for tracks-to-show-off-the-subwoofer xD.

Total: 24 points

### Avelho: DizAlgo

 - Rhythm: 4 points.  A bit difficult to keep track of, but not altogether irregular.
 - Story: 5 points.  The story really does keep one involved.  The delay in the beginning felt off, but was forgivable.  The section at 1:08 definitely got my head bobbing, though it was a tad sudden.
 - Catchy: 3 points.  There are *some* really good phrases in this.
 - Main Plugin Use: 5 points.  All sorts of pianos, some distorted, some not, generally a good mix.
 - Overall Beat: 5 points.  Adding this to my playlist.

Total: 22 points

### Spotlight Kyd: Spring Break

 - Rhythm:  5 points.  The drums give off a bit of a Latin music vibe, which is neat.
 - Story: 4 points.  Quite nice, but lacks a defined crescendo.
 - Catchy: 4 points.  The trumpet (I presume?) at 0:55 definitely sets a nice phrase that the song later returns to.
 - Main Plugin Use: 3 points.  I do hear the piano in there, but it is a bit overpowered by the brass instruments.  Maybe the piano could be a little louder?  I'm not sure.
 - Overall Beat: 4 points.  I was a bit bored until 0:30, at which point the beat knocked me flat.

Total: 20 points.

### A-Lin: Dai Mi Kunefe

 - Rhythm: 5 points.  Very consistent, yet not repetitive from beat to beat.
 - Story: 4 points.  From the beginning of the song to 1:30 is beautiful.  It almost seems like from 1:30 to 3:00 is the first part modified and repeated, though.  It is different, but it feels a little weird that the song "ends" on a high note and fades out three times.  Reminds me of Ludovico Einaudi's "Nuvole Bianche", though without the crescendo/climax.
 - Catchy: 3 points.  The beginning riff is very nice, but the rest of the song kind of fades into the background of my memory.  I listened to it three times while writing this, and I can only remember the beginning.
 - Main Plugin Use: 4 points. I haven't looked at your source (Ardour doesn't like me) but, by ear, it seems you have used two, perhaps three different pianos, there is a soft one, a bell like one, and maybe another that is more a "standard" ePiano.  Nice variation.
 - Overall Beat: 2 points.  Not really my style, but great if I want to sit down and write an essay of something similar.

Total: 18 points

### Trumpetrespas: PianoMania

 - Rhythm: 4 points.  Jazzy.  The hi-hat/cymbal is a bit too loud, but generally not bad.
 - Story: 3 points.  Not a whole lot of start and end here.  Almost seems like a excerpt from a jazz jam session.  Also feels like it closed on the wrong chord, but maybe that's just me.
 - Catchy: 4 points.  Not a particular phrase that sticks in my head here, but jazz is inherently catchy.
 - Main Plugin Use: 3 points.  Not a lot a variation here, but it is entirely piano aside from the drums.
 - Overall Beat: 4 points.  Generally groovy.

Total: 18 points

### nyxeles: At End, At Last

Note: There are some "clicks" in the song, not sure if they are x-runs or intentional, though I think they add character.

 - Rhythm: 4 points.  Generally pretty nice; the "bouncy" kick drums were an interesting touch.  Could have been ~5bpm faster, though.
 - Story: 3 points.  Felt like it was going somewhere but never did.  Aside from that, generally a nice story.  Towards the end, though, it did not feel resolved, and also seemed to end twice.
 - Catchy: 3 points.  Nothing really stands out to me, but the bass at 1:18 is kinda catchy.
 - Main Plugin Use: 3 points.  Little variation, also not really the main part of the song, but that's forgivable.
 - Overall Beat: 4 points.  The start of the bass at 1:18 could have been formulated a bit better, but the rest of it is quite nice.

Total: 17 points.

### Min Jun Gi: My Diary Is Like An Old Piano

 - Rhythm: 5 points.  Consistent.
 - Story: 4 points.  No climax.  Otherwise very nice.  IMHO, all songs, slow or fast, need a climax; see Lionel Yu's "Colors of the Soul" for an example of this.
 - Catchy: 3 points.  It is somewhat catchy, but some of it feels a tad... generic, I guess? Not really sure how else to describe it or what makes me say that.
 - Main Plugin Use: 3 points.  Again, I don't have your DAW installed, but by ear, it seems like there are two pianos, one for the main melody/right hand and one for the left hand. Not a lot of variation, but not bad.
 - Overall Beat: 2 points.  Like A-Lin's entry, not really my style, but a nice composition nonetheless.

Total: 17 points

### sg75: Vaulting Velocities

 - Rhythm: 3 points.  A little hard to keep track of.  The beginning was almost like a "dirty" synthesizer bit.  That can be cool, but I'm not sure your execution was as good as it could be.
 - Story: 4 points.  The story is definitely there.  The buildup at the end is very nice, the end itself too.  The beginning/middle lacked story, but the melody was pretty good.
 - Catchy: 3 points.  The only really catchy part of your song (to me, at least) is the end, with the alternating high notes.
 - Main Plugin Use:  4 points.  This is almost a One Synth Challenge sort of thing, most of it is piano, yet one can't really tell because of the effects.
 - Overall Beat: 3 points.  The beginning is not my favorite, but I like the end quite a lot.

Total: 17 points.

### Amberdrake: Burning Skies

 - Rhythm: 5 points. Drums really do make everything better.
 - Story: 3 points. Very interesting.  Would not want to be in a haunted mansion while this was playing. Not a whole lot of story behind it, rather consistent across the song.
 - Catchy: 2 points. The song itself is memorable, but not because of any particular riff or phrase.
 - Main Plugin Use: 2 Points. I got to this section and then realized I hadn't heard too much piano.  Not a bad thing for the song, really, and I do hear it in some places, but I am sticking to a criteria.
 - Overall Beat: 4 points.  Pretty nice, definitely a cross between metal and spooky that I didn't know existed. Overall, was disappointed when it ended (in a good way).  My subwoofer wants to know what you were thinking with that low note.

Total: 16 points


Overall, everyone did a great job, which is why I resorted to so many criteria.  All of these songs are really good in their own way, making them difficult to score, yet pleasant to listen to.  I hope to see you next time!

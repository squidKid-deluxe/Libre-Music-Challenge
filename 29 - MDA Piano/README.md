Sequences (midi file) created via Seq192 + Yamaha P125 as midi controller
Drums from Behringer RD-8 hardware device (Modern 808 clone)

2 instances of MDA Piano, one for the chord progression and one for the melody
1 instance of MDA ePiano, for the bass progession

Everything is routed together in Carla.
The order and timing of sequences is done by manually enabling/disabling tracks in Seq192.
I used Audacity to mix together the piano and drums, as well as to add the reverse crash.

`MDA piano.flac` is the final file, everything else is dev logs.

# Arpeggio Echoes: Harmonic Reflections
## MDA Piano and MDA ePiano

Sequences (midi file) created via Seq192 + Yamaha P125 as midi controller
Drums from Behringer RD-8 hardware device (Roland TR-808 clone)
Bassline in into from Behringer TD-3-MO hardware device (Roland TB-303 upgraded clone)

#### Plugins Used:
 - 1 instance of MDA Piano, for the secondary melody
 - 2 instances of MDA ePiano, one for the bassline later in the song, other for the melody
 - 1 instance of Calf Reverb
 - 1 instance of a "MIDI Note To CC" plugin that came with Ubuntu Studio (for controlling Calf Reverb via seq192)

Everything is routed together in Carla; I used Audacity to record from my MV802 mixer.

`Arpeggio Echoes: Harmonic Reflections.flac` is the final file, everything else is dev logs.
See screenshots folder for how it all looks.
